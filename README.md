# prince-sample-pilet

A pilet running the Prince of Persia game for the `sample-piral` app shell.

Used in the [sample application](https://demo-full.piral.io) for [Piral](https://piral.io), which is a framework for microfrontends.

**[Demo online](https://demo-full.piral.io/prince-of-persia)**

You can run it locally, too. Just clone and then:

```sh
npm i && npm start
```

This will install the remaining dependencies and then run the application.
